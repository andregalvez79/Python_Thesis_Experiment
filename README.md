# Python_Thesis_Experiment
This is the experiment I created to measure Pavlovian biases in intertemporal choices.
This experiment was created in Psychopy2.
In order to Run the whole experiment. You need the image files in the same folder where the scripts are saved.
Change where the files are retieved inside the pit5 script.
First run the pavloviantrial and the tdtrsanferphase script. 
you can change #create a window were everything will be displayed
win = visual.Window(color = "black", fullscr = False) to
win = visual.Window(color = "black", fullscr = True) for full screen

The output are .csv file separted by a comma (,).
